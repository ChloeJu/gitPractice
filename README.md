Why Interesting
-----------
This link is about C# and shader programming for Unity. They build on one another, introducing new programming concepts, math, algorithms, and Unity features. They're useful to both novice and experienced developers.
I recommand people who are interested in game development or visulization of data to take a look.
Thank you!
